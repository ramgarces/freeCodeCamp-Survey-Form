# freeCodeCamp-Survey-Form
My attempt at the Survey Form from the Responsive Web Design projects on freeCodeCamp.org

<p>This was actually my second attempt at the project. The first attempt I did directly on codepen.io because that is what was suggested on freeCodeCamp.org. However, I was not happy with the form at all and I was having trouble with the formatting on the integrated text editor, so I started a second attempt using VS Code on my local machine.</p>

<p>After a couple of months of not doing any coding with HTML or CSS, I decided to give freeCodeCamp.org a try. I had been going through the Python course that they offer, but after watching some of Dorian Dominguez' videos on YouTube (Dorian Develops) I decided to jump back into learning skills for front-end development - this time I was going to go all out. So, I started doing the courses in order, as suggested by the website. The projects at the end of the Responsive Web Design section are my first projects that I actually do on my own - without a tutorial video or anything. Of course, like any aspiring developer I am utilizing Google - a lot - but I am happy that I am making progress even if it is slow.</p>
